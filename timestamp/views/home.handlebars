<h1>Welcome to my Timestamp API</h1>
<h2>How it works:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural
        language date.</li>
    <li>It returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date</li>
    <li>If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties</li>
</ol>
